# Simple-FAQ-Bot-using-Python
FAQBot is a straightforward chatbot designed to quickly answer frequently asked questions (FAQs). 

## How It Works:
* Tokenization: Breaks down user queries and FAQ questions into individual words.
* Word Matching: Identifies common words between the user's query and the available FAQs.
* Best Match Selection: Selects the FAQ with the highest number of matching words as the most relevant answer.
* Response Generation: Provides the answer associated with the selected FAQ or a default response if no suitable match is found.

## Potential Enhancements:

* NLP Techniques: Integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) for improved understanding of user intent.
* Similarity Measures: Explore more advanced similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity) beyond simple word matching.
* Contextual Understanding: Add the ability to maintain conversation context for multi-turn interactions.
* Integration Options: Make it easy to embed FAQBot into various platforms (Discord, Slack, web widgets).
